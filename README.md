RUNNING THE CODE
- run the python file (form.py) and answer the questionnaire. It will inform if CCPA is applicable.
- open s(CASP) terminal and compile the perl codes in the below order to validate. One can compile them using "[file_name]."
  -> [companies].

  -> [principles].
  -> [main].
- now enter the following query "run."
  This will query the rule "run" in the main.pl file.

INSPIRATION

Current increase in data privacy and cybersecurity trends.

WHAT IT DOES

This assistant is aimed to help businesses with consumers based in California by checking the businesses' compliance to CCPA rules and guidelines.

HOW WE BUILT IT

The base logic and reasoning is written in Prolog and s(CASP) while the business interface for questions is written in Python3.

CHALLENGES WE RAN INTO

Knowledge Representation and Reasoning based language was new to the entire team, so being different from the languages we were used to, we had to come up with new approaches and out of the box thinking.

ACCOMPLISHMENT THAT WE'RE PROUD OF

We were able to create an assistant that we set out to build. We are proud of being able to reach very close to what we had initially planned.

WHAT WE LEARNED

We learned a language based on KRR and added a new toolkit in our arsenal to solve common sense reasoning based problems in future.

WHAT'S NEXT

To implement it for other similar compliance acts. Provide more insights based on the questionnaire using more rules and facts. Create a historical database for companies to keep track of their progress. Provide companies with solutions to minimize losses.
